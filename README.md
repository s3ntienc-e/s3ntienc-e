### ׂ╰┈➤ Helloooo, my name is Artzii, or Akaii, if you so wish!

#### ── .✦ I really like Forsaken, as most times you'll find me cosplaying as some of the characters. However, from time to time, I also like cosplaying other various characters from gacha games such as Genshin Impact, Cookie Run Kingdom and such! 
**DISCLAIMER: IF I AM COSPLAYING ANY MYTHS ASSOCIATED WITH PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOUR, I DO NOT SUPPORT THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FROM. I PURELY COSPLAY THEM FOR THE LOVE OF THE CHARACTER, EITHER DESIGN OR LORE WISE.**

#### ── .✦ I am not particularily social, as I happen to find interactions quite exhausting pretty often. Regardless, unless specified, I encourage you to come up to me! I might not talk a lot, but I will surely be more than happy to cuddle!

#### ── .✦ Some of my hobbies are painting, digital drawing and occasionally writing.

#### ── .✦ I have a very big interest in clowns and jesters, most of my comfort characters being such, aswell as my personal style representing it.
